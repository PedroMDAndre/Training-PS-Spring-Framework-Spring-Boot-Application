# Spring Framework: Creating Your First Spring Boot Application
## Course Description

Spring Boot framework helps developers to build scalable Java applications. In this course, Creating your First Spring Boot Application, you will learn the two core aspects of Spring Boot by coding through the basics with a sample application. First, you will learn the stand-alone architecture of Spring Boot without containers and XML files. Your app runs as a pure Java app and can be deployed in any environment that runs Java, including cloud platforms. Next, you will discover Spring Boot starters. These starters allow quick and easy integration with many Spring technologies and 3rd Party libraries and frameworks. Additionally, starters provide the concept of auto-configuration, allowing developers to incorporate concepts such as data sources or REST services. Finally, you will be able to install Spring Boot, configure it, and utilize many of the framework's features in a real world application. By the end of this course, you will be able to understand the Spring Boot architecture and how it plugs in and works with core Spring.
